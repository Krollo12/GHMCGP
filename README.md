# HMCGP
Implementation of the Heteroscedastic Multi-output Censored Gaussan Process

The implemented models are included in the "GP_models" module, along with the various likelihoods in "GP_likelihoods". Inference is done using Pyro's SVI and all training loops are defined in the "main" jupyter notebook.
